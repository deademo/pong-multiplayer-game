I want to create web game which is basically ping pong game it must to have Backend. I also want people to be able to play together, so it's a maximum two players game, so it basically means multiplayer game. Front-end and back-end should communicate over WebSockets. For a database I want to see Postgres I want to have rooms in this game, which means player can open the game, create a room Thank you. copy invite code or invite link and send it to another one person so they can play together. Nobody else can join the room when two persons are join the room.
Also game should have another one invite link which will be exclusively for Yeah. observers, not players, so people can see how two players are playing.
Um... Each match should be up to... Configurable amount of points. By default it's 5 but can be extended to 20, 50 and 100.
