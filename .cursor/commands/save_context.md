Please take all of your knowledge and same it into context folder in the root into the file called by
%N%_%NAME%.md. Where %N% is an index of the file, you should pick the latest one index by scanning "context" folder and finding what the last one index is. So current index is last one + 1.
%NAME% is a snake space name which describes in 3-5 words what this context about.

context file should contain all the experience you have and commands you used.
This context file is goign to be used by next LLM session and these context files will help
LLMs in future do much less mistakes.
Don't make context file small, don't try to save tokens or words, do it very extensive.
More your knowledge you put into file - more effecient next LLMs will be.
